# DISCLAIMER #
# Put in your own strategy before taking any of this live
# I am not a financial advisor and I do not know if this solana bot works, or will work in the future. This is all just a test.

# This course intentionally gives you the pieces and not a full running bot. I do not believe
# in giving plug and play bots because if we all run the same strategy, this would never work
# ill never release a plug and play bot, and if you see that online, run. There is a good chance
# that there is malicious code, or the strategy is going to 0. do not buy pre-built bots
# my goal from this solana course is to teach you how to build your own bot with your own strategy
# I do my best in this course to show you every single lego piece I used to build the current bot you see on YouTube
# if for any reason, you want a refund, we have a 100% money back guarantee 
# we will refund your money immediately if you ever feel like you dont get the value you pay for in any of my products
# I will never sell a plug and play bot, I want to teach you how to code your own, so you can build for the rest of your life.
# ps - I will never dm you on discord offering a bot either, be careful out there.
